# SAP HANA Manufacturing Simulation – Supply Chain & Operations Analytics

## Overview
This project documents my participation in an SAP HANA–based manufacturing simulation focused on supply chain and operations decision-making. The simulation modeled end-to-end production planning, inventory management, and demand variability within an ERP environment.

The objective was to use data-driven decisions to balance service level, capacity utilization, inventory costs, and profitability across multiple planning cycles.

## Tools & Platform
- SAP HANA Manufacturing Simulation (ERP-based)
- KPI dashboards provided within the simulation environment

---

## Key Analytical Areas
- Production planning and capacity utilization
- Inventory level management and cost trade-offs
- Demand variability and service level stability
- Profitability tracking across iterative decision rounds

---

## KPIs Evaluated
- Service level
- Capacity utilization
- Inventory levels and holding costs
- Lead time
- Cumulative profitability

---

## Approach
- Analyzed simulation dashboards to understand demand, capacity, and cost constraints
- Compared KPI outcomes across multiple planning cycles
- Adjusted production and inventory decisions based on KPI feedback
- Balanced cost efficiency with service level stability

---

## Results
- Achieved **Top 2 ranking** among participating teams
- Strong cumulative profit performance
- Stable service levels with controlled inventory variance

---

## Key Learnings
- Importance of KPI-driven decision-making in ERP systems
- Trade-offs between service level, inventory cost, and utilization
- How SAP HANA supports operational analytics and planning decisions
- Relevance of ERP analytics to asset utilization and cost optimization
